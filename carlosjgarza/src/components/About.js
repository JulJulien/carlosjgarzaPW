                I am a Senior Undergraduate from the University of Texas at the Rio Grande Valley, pursuing Bachelor of Science in Computer Science! I am currently seeking a full-time position as a Software Developer. 
                Most of my education and experience has been in Software Development but I am also expanding into the field of Data Science and pursuing a Minor in Data Science and Buisness Analytics.
                In my free time I love coding in the Unity Game Engine in C#! Its a great way for me to incorporate coding practice and creativity.
